The election of Jair Bolsonaro, in 2018, was a gamble by the ruling classes to advance the neoliberal economic project, radically weakening the living conditions of the population. The approval of the Pension Reform – which, in practice, represents a dismantling of retirement – ​​is an example. Inflation and the rising cost of living skyrocketed, with people becoming increasingly hungry and even resorting to bones to survive!

In addition, during the Covid-19 pandemic, the government adopted a genocidal policy, sabotaging prevention measures and refusing to buy vaccines. Officially, in Brazil, we have more than 600,000 deaths from the disease. How many lives could have been preserved?

The Lula and Alckmin ticket, which proposes a policy of conciliation to make itself viable in the face of the ruling classes, will have difficulties. The current global economic climate is unfavorable, with a war going on in Europe, which contributes to domestic economic difficulties. Brazil has also gone through an intense process of de-industrialization in the last 20 years, being even more dependent on the export of agribusiness products.

Bolsonaro's possible electoral defeat in 2022, as much as it seems like a relief, does not solve the problems. Even if he loses the presidency, the so-called “bolsonarism” will persist in the next period, which symbolizes the worst – fascism, racism, misogyny, LGBTQIA+phobia and ultra-liberal economic perspectives. The base that makes up Bolsonarism is active and violent – ​​see the attacks and murders against political opponents and against any people contrary to their “myth”.

We cannot ignore, therefore, the risks that the extreme right represents, advancing between police and military, CACs, religious, ruralists and the like. It is essential that we assume combativeness based on direct action and self-defense. The retreat of sectors of the left so as not to displease the elites in the electoral process is a mistake, as it strengthens the violent actions of the extreme right Bolsonarista.

As organized and revolutionary anarchists, we reinforce that the electoral dispute is not enough to make the necessary transformations for those from below, nor to stop the offensive of the extreme right. It is necessary a decisive confrontation and the strengthening of popular movements and grassroots instances, carrying out the struggle in a radical way. Only the organized and combative struggle is able to bring achievements to those from below and stop the advance of Bolsonarism!

### The union bureaucracy

The current political conjuncture demands from us, the working class, an organizational response and an increasingly strong struggle in defense of the rights conquered in the past and in the advancement of improvements in living and working conditions.

In education the situation is no different! In recent years, attacks on pensions; the advance of privatization and outsourcing; the policy of death in the pandemic and the devaluation of wages took tens of thousands of workers in education and other public services in the municipality to the streets. However, even with the disposition and impetus of the bases, the union leaderships, especially the current board of Sinpeem and Cláudio Fonseca, were more interested in conciliatory arrangements with the government, betraying the category and selling defeats as achievements!

Cláudio Fonseca and his board, contrary to the interests of the majority of the category, sent union elections in the middle of the pandemic, when we were in isolation and with a high number of deaths in the city. The election proceeded even with the demand for postponement, forwarded by the other slates - who even withdrew from the process, out of respect for the workers. The result was an election without political debate and with very low membership, in a demonstration of dissatisfaction!

We also remind you that elections for Regional Councilors have not been called for years!

Contradictorily, Sinpeem kept its doors closed under the argument of protection from the pandemic, while part of the school board remained in face-to-face work.

It is important to highlight that, in this period, contracts with outsourced companies were terminated; reduction in the number of workers in cleaning and kitchen services; hiring family members of students on a precarious temporary basis! Amid the 2021 health strike, once again Cláudio Fonseca abandoned the category, which had its salaries cut by the government of Covas and Nunes. He did not organize the strike fund, the primary reason for the existence of a union, supporting the government's authoritarianism in publications and speeches. Even so, the category proved resistant and did not leave the streets, radicalizing the actions and self-organizing, through the Regional Commands, the solidary support to those who did not receive their earnings.

In the second half of 2021, we once again fought a tough fight against the new pension reform. The struggle also counted on the radicalization of the workers, who blocked paths; they mobilized central and regional acts; camped in front of the City Hall – even with rain and cold. The strike ended under repression by the GCM. We were defeated, but we left standing and with our heads held high, convinced of the strength of the base of the category – even in the face of a board that once again acted far below what was necessary in the face of the harsh attack by the government.

In order to resist the current situation and advance in the struggles for rights and valorization, we need an organizational instrument that really meets the demands of workers. A combative and popular union.

### For grassroots democracy and a true struggle union

The theme of this 31st Congress is “Education and Democracy”, which also leads us to urgently think about our union structure! We understand that the organization of the union is not an end in itself and must make the struggles of the category viable, but the way in which it is structured can both dynamize and hinder the movement of teachers in their struggles. We need to end the reign of Cláudio Fonseca and his board, who haven't set foot on the floor of a school for decades. But for us, just changing the direction is not enough.

We understand that a union structure that effectively meets the interests of its category must start from the base itself – in our case, in schools! For this to occur, there must be a re-signification of the instance of the REs, in which the voice of workers is manifested.

Currently, the meetings of School Representatives are mere “takes and brings back” of the decisions taken by the union board. There is practically a monopoly of speeches and with little open space, which leads to a fierce dispute between the opposition, which mostly question this logic.

Therefore, for there to be a change in this structure, the RE must be a deliberative instance: fundamental political decisions must be forwarded in this space, with greater freedom and speaking time for everyone present. In order to streamline the meetings, bring the union closer to the category and to other struggles in territories, the reopening of the sub-headquarters is of paramount importance, a decision even approved in previous Congresses and not carried out by the board of Cláudio Fonseca.

The subheadquarters, provided for in the Sinpeem Statute, could make it possible to build a union from below and would reinforce a closer relationship between the category and the organization. This is a fundamental issue, as the distance between the union and the workers means that the instrument of struggle is reduced to mere labor advice.

With the sub-headquarters, the Regional Councils would also gain greater dynamics and function: effectively organize each region, promote regional bulletins and forward the deliberations of each sub-headquarters to the General Council — which should discuss them, approve them or give feedback to the sub-headquarters. when not approved. We remind you that the Sinpeem Statute determines that the elections for Regional Councilors take place biennially.

Another key point to be discussed is bureaucratization. It is not just a question of ethics and justice, but of considering the perverse effects that bureaucracy brings: for example, lack of legitimacy before the category and the notion that the “union solves” without the need for participation.

Finally, the image that the union represents the workers in the same way that a deputy of the bourgeois parliament does. In summary, bureaucratization kills the union as a tool for organizing and mobilizing the category. Union whose leadership has been crystallized for decades in their positions needs urgently to be rethought!

The re-election of the union's board of directors and, mainly, of its president, could not pass at once and its role should be minimized. The role of the union's board of directors should only be executive, that is, comply with the deliberations forwarded by each region. If it does not fulfill its functions or when it adopts practices that disrespect the decisions of the category, the board should be revoked. The executive role of the board is also provided for in the Statute, but again we realize that the practice is reversed, as the president behaves like a monarch.

In a category composed mostly of women, it is even possible to discuss gender proportionality for the occupation of directorships, thus avoiding sexist and misogynist policies and attitudes, as already denounced by colleagues in previous Congresses.

We know the path is long and difficult. Our fight against governments and bosses will never cease as long as we live in a society organized by capital, but we need the working class to add more and more strength and our instruments must not reproduce the logic of the capitalist system.

It is with the organization of those from below that we join forces to overthrow those from above and accumulate experiences to manage a new society, without the presence of capital and the State – a self-organized society!
